# Image-Tampering
Based on [Digital Image Tamper Detection Technique Based on Spectrum Analysis of CFA Artifacts](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/327255730_Digital_Image_Tamper_Detection_Technique_Based_on_Spectrum_Analysis_of_CFA_Artifacts)

Largely untested as I've never found any image that followed the assumption where variance of interpolated pixels from the green channel is quarter of the variation of the acquired pixels. $(\sigma_I\approx\frac{1}{2}\sigma_A)$
